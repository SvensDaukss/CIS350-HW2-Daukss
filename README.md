# Svens Daukss
* I am an avid freestyle skier in the winter. I enjoy spinning on and off rails. I also enjoy flipping and spinning on jumps. If there is a snow day I am probably on the slopes.
* I also enjoy time by the lake. Wakeboarding, tubing, and driving crazy on the jet ski. 
* I like to travel and am up for an adventure. Some places I have traveled to are Colorado, Florida, new York, Utah and Oregon.
